## Steps to Implement

1. **In `robotic_dog.py`:**

   * Create a class `RoboticDog`.
   * Implement functions for:

     * Initializing dog attributes (name, etc.).
     * Moving legs realistically (front/back leg motion).
     * Fetching a stick.
     * Updating dog state (battery, position, etc.).

2. **In `game.py`:**

   * Import the `RoboticDog` class:

     ```python
     from robotic_dog import RoboticDog
     ```
   * Create a `RoboticDog` instance.
   * Integrate it with the provided game engine.
   * Use the dog’s functions (movement, fetch, etc.) in gameplay.

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install pygame
   ```

   *(The `random` module is included by default in Python.)*

4. **Run the Game:**

   ```bash
   python3 game.py
   ```
